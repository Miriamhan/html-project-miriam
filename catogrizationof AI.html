<h1>categorization of Artifical intelligance</h1><hr>
<p>Artificial intelligence can be divided into two different categories: weak and strong</p>
<p2><u><b>Weak artificial intelligence</b></u> embodies a system designed to carry out one particular job. Weak AI systems include video games such as the chess example from above and personal assistants such as Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. You ask the assistant a question, it answers it for you.</p2><br><br>

<h3>What Is Weak AI?</h3>
<p>Weak artificial intelligence (AI)—also called narrow AI—is a type of artificial intelligence that is limited to a specific or narrow area. Weak AI simulates human cognition. It has the potential to benefit society by automating time-consuming tasks and by analyzing data in ways that humans sometimes can’t. Weak AI can be contrasted to strong AI, a theoretical form of machine intelligence that is equal to human intelligence.</p><br><br>
<h4>Limitations of Weak AI</h4>
<p>Besides its limited capabilities, some of the problems with weak AI include the possibility to cause harm if a system fails­. For example, consider a driverless car that miscalculates the location of an oncoming vehicle and causes a deadly collision. The system also has the possibility to cause harm if the system is used by someone who wishes to cause harm; consider a terrorist who uses a self-driving car to deploy explosives in a crowded area.</p><br><br>

<p3><u><b>Strong artificial Intelligence</b></u> systems are systems that carry on the tasks considered to be human-like. These tend to be more complex and complicated systems. They are programmed to handle situations in which they may be required to problem solve without having a person intervene. These kinds of systems can be found in applications like self-driving cars or in hospital operating rooms.</p3>
<h5>What Is Strong AI</h5>
<p>Strong Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a theoretical form of machine intelligence that is equal to human intelligence. Key characteristics of Strong AI include the ability to reason, solve puzzles, make judgments, plan, learn, and communicate. It should also have consciousness, objective thoughts, self-awareness, sentience, and sapience.</p><br>
<h6>Risks and Rewards of Strong AI</h6>
<p>he possibility of Strong AI comes with major potential benefits and serious concerns. Some people fear that if Strong AI becomes a reality, AI may become more intelligent than humans, a phenomenon known as the singularity. The idea is that Strong AI will be so intelligent that it can alter itself and pursue its own goals without human intervention, possibly in ways that are harmful to humans</p><br>
